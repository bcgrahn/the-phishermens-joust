### Description:
The core concepts and ideas of this project were inspired by a PlayStation 3 and 4 game, 
JS Joust. The game is played by holding a PlayStation Move controller in each hand,
attempting to knock the controllers out of your opponents' hands while keeping your own
controller steady. We were tasked with updating the game by rewriting the core features and modernizing the mechanics. Instead of a PlayStation controller, a phone would be used. The goal of the game is to try and keep your phone as still as possible and eliminate other players by bumping their phones. In addition, powerups are randomly awarded during the game.
